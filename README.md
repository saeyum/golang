I am learning go language from beginning to advance and will upload material on daily basis so that person who wants to learn or have desire to learn can learn with me the most demanding language of future . Here i will start from beginning which will include installation step including th probelms faced like what command you have to write in your terminal.
I suggest you guys to make a separate virtual machine using virtualbox and install linux on that so it will be easy to handle work on single platform .
