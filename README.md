# golang
I am learning go language from beginning to advance and will upload material on daily basis so that person who wants to learn or have desire to learn can learn with me the most demanding language of future . Here i will start from beginning which will include installation step including th probelms faced like what command you have to write in your terminal.
I suggest you guys to make a separate virtual machine using virtualbox and install linux on that so it will be easy to handle work on single platform . 
You can install go lalnguage from www.golang.org there you will get choice between operating system which operating system you want to use and have to setup some path for that with the help of terminal instruction is there on website only .
Now its you wish you can cde through simple text editor or you can install vscode (visual studio code) IDE which support different languages and there you can install support for go language .
After that you have to create one folder and open that folder in vscode there you will store all the file with .go extension .
Three commands which you have to remember everytime when you are going to run file with go extension .
1. code filename.go
2. go run filename.go
3. go build filename.go(it will generate binary)
Basically go language work with packages so that it will help in to increase modularity . suppose you are making package name as main in three different files so it will automatically append all the three files so there is no need of setting up branching fron your side .
Go language use main function to run any code of lines firstly it will execute main funtion . 
****import fmt 
fmt library is used for  different printing function . 
so we are starting with our basic programme which is common in all language i.e. hello world(you guys able to find the code here in this repository only ).
